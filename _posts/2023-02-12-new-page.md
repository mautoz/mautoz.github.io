<center>Hello, World!</center>
     
I couldn't start my new page without write the most tradicional quote from devs.

Well, I downloaded this beautiful theme for GitHub Page, but I'm not a Ruby dev. I've been studing since yesterday and I'm remembering many thing about Jekyll, but I need to study more and more. 

I think until next weekend I will have finished configure all this blog.

That is it!

Seen you soon!
