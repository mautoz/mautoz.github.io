Despite my love for programming, sometimes we need to stop coding and do some different things! One of my favorite hobbies is pop culture! I love movies, tv series and books! Me and my friends created a blog/podcast called [Tropa Dercy]() where we talk about movies like Batman, series from Marvel (and others) or books like 'Battle Royale'. I would invite you to visit our blog and see what we are doing! 

PS: I strongly recommend our 'movies lists'!
